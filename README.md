# This project was made while I was taking part in School of Analytics Hackathon 2023. In the following, you'll see the spec of the case.

## Introduction
AdTech agency TechDesign, which provides solutions in the field of advertising technologies, has developed a new model for calculating the rate (i.e. cost per click) for ads for an advertising campaign. As an alternative to the existing “Maximum Bet” bidding model, the company introduced a new advertising solution – the “Average Bet” bidding model.
After introducing the new option, the eStore company, which is one of the agency’s clients and conducts a retargeting advertising campaign using the “Maximum Bid” model, decided to test an alternative calculation model.

In order to make a comparison between the “Average Rate” and “Maximum Rate” calculation models, eStore conducted A/B testing over the next month. As an eStore data analyst, you will have to analyze the results of A/B testing and submit an analytical report to the company’s management.
You have received data with the results of an A/B test and want to make sure that the experiment was carried out correctly and the result was statistically reliable.
As part of this task, you have determined the following steps for yourself:
Task 1. Checking the division of observations into experimental and control groups based on data obtained after the experiment
Task 2. Calculation of metrics based on data obtained after the experiment. Checking normality of distribution
Task 3. Formulating a hypothesis. Selection of a statistical criterion for testing a hypothesis
Task 4. Defining parameters for A/B groups. Conducting an A/A test to evaluate parameters. Checking the representativeness and homogeneity of samples
Task 5. Calculating key metrics. Assessment of the statistical significance of the results obtained. Estimation of errors of the first and second types
